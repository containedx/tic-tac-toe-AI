# TIC TAC TOE with AI PLAYER

Known to all minigame - tic tac toe, with intelligent opponent. Created with **Minimax Algorithm**. 

In main menu you can choose who starts game - computer(O) or human(X). It is little agaist rules, since in real tic tac toe X always goes first, but *who cares* !

When AI goes first - you have to put X in the middle not to loose. Every other move will end in failure. You can never win.
If human (you) goes first there is also no way to win with AI. Your best chance is a tie.
